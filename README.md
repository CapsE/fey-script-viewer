# Fey-Script Viewer

This is just a small test project to see fey-script in action.

Since fey-script is not published on npm.com yet you have to clone the fey-script package
and run ```yarn link``` in the cloned directory to make it accessible locally.

In this directory run ```yarn link fey-script``` to "install" the package. Then run ```yarn``` to 
install needed public packages and ``yarn dev`` to run the dev server.

The code that will be rendered can be set in src/main.tsx
